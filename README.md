# CodeLiteSourceCodeAccess

Source Code accessor for Unreal Engine 4 Editor. 

## Note
Integrated into upstream Unreal Engine 4.9+. However, you might want to use this repo again when using UE4.18+ so everything after 4.18. The one inside the UE4 project doesn't work correct anymore.

Best regards,
